# Quantum Network Simulator GUI

A user-friendly GUI for designing and simulating quantum networks using PyQt5.

## Features

- **Add Nodes:** Place nodes representing different quantum network components.
- **Connect Nodes:** Establish connections (edges) between nodes.
- **Edit Node Properties:** Customize node attributes like type, number of qubits, qubit technology, coherence time, and photon insertion loss.
- **Add Nodes by Coordinates:** Precisely place nodes by specifying X and Y coordinates.
- **Save and Load Networks:** Save your network configurations and load them later.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LucasRhode-png/QuantumNetSim.git
